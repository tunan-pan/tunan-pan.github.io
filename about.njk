      <h1>A bit about me</h1>
      
      <p>Design, for me, has always been about <strong>helping people and making the world a better place.</strong> After nearly a decade working as a graphic designer and art director for mission-driven organizations, I reached a point of burnout that pushed me to pause and reflect. That pause gave me space to reflect on how I can keep contributing in ways that are both more sustainable for me, <em>and</em> more impactful for the people I design for.</p>
      
      <p>With a lifelong love for interactive design — from the earliest days of coding websites for my Neopets, to my more recent explorations of game dev, AR/XR, and WebGL — <strong>shifting my focus now to UX and UI design</strong> really feels like coming home. In UX, I see the opportunity to champion accessibility and human-centered design practices that were difficult to implement in my previous roles. I'm still learning and exploring, but excited to see where this path takes me!</p>
      
      <p><span aria-hidden="true">&#127793;</span> Currently I'm learning about accessibility in JavaScript and bringing those best practices to digital games on Board Game Arena. (Case study coming soon!)</p>

    <p>As an Asian New Zealander, queer, and neurodivergent woman, I bring a unique perspective that shapes how I approach design. I notice the details, am always questioning "why?", and care deeply about making sure design works for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

    <h2><span aria-hidden="true">&#129505;</span> Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of design, I also enjoy channeling my creativity into drawing, cosplay, and baking. Other things that bring me joy include: being around animals and in nature, playing video/board games, reading, ice skating, and munching on a good crunchy snack :)</p>

            <h2>What the fox?</h2>
            <p>I've always felt a connection to foxes, with their playful curiosity but shy caution, their big bushy tail ready to balance, hold, or hide themselves. They share traits with both dogs and cats, but don't quite belong with either, instead existing in that in-between space — something I relate to deeply.</p>
            
            <p>When it came to creating my own brand, incorporating a fox felt necessary. The logo you see distills a fox's head into a simple geometric form that also suggests a heart — a reminder of how I try to move through the world: <strong>genuine, empathetic, intuitive, and guided by my values.</strong></p>
