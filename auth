backend: cd backend, npm run dev
frontend: npm start, npm run fetch-data


_data/projects.js - Simply loads the static JSON file
scripts/fetch-strapi-data.js - Fetches from Strapi and saves to projects_build.json (run this manually before deploying)
project-pagination.njk - Creates individual project pages
_includes/project-layout.njk - Layout for displaying each project

Workflow:

Work in Strapi locally
Run npm run fetch-data when ready to build
Images in markdown will render properly
Deploy to GitHub Pages
